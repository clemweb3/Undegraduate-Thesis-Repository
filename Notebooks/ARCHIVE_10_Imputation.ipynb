    "### Imputation Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not impute inconsistent/partial variables by default.** Only consider imputation if the variable is conceptually indispensable and FMI suggests the information can be credibly recovered (e.g., plausible MAR with auxiliary predictors).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not reasonable to impute inconsistent/partial variables without first considering FMI and context. Imputation is not a neutral operation; it encodes assumptions about the missingness mechanism, temporal comparability, and the meaning of the variable. If a variable is inconsistent across months/years, imputing it can fabricate continuity that wasn’t in the data, undermining factor analysis and comparability across regions and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 1 — Consistent variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Eligible for imputation.\n",
    "- Rule: Use FMI to determine imputation intensity (light/cautious/advanced).\n",
    "- Justification: Stable measurement; imputation supports matrix completion for EFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 2 — Partial variables (intermittent presence or minor coding drift):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Conditional imputation.\n",
    "- Rule: Impute only if FMI is moderate/high but MAR plausibility exists via auxiliary predictors, and coding is harmonized; otherwise flag for sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "- Justification: Limited comparability; treat as supporting evidence, not core FA inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 3 — Inconsistent variables (structural changes, major coding breaks):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: Do not impute for FA.\n",
    "- Rule: Document and retain for diagnostics; consider future harmonization projects or use in qualitative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justification: Imputation would manufacture comparability and can distort factor structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Override - Conceptual indispensability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: If a variable is central to sensitivity/resilience/exposure and lacks a close proxy, allow imputation even if partial, but only with:\n",
    "- Explicit MAR argument using auxiliary variables,\n",
    "- complete coding evidence, and\n",
    "- Sensitivity analyses comparing included vs excluded."

    "**Why imputing inconsistent variables without FMI review is not defensible?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement instability:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistent variables often arise because the survey question changed, coding shifted, or the variable wasn’t asked in some rounds. Imputing them blindly assumes the missingness is random noise, when in fact it reflects structural differences. That creates false comparability across years.\n",
    "**Factor analysis assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "FA assumes each variable measures the same construct across all observations. If a variable is inconsistent, imputing values fabricates continuity that wasn’t there. This risks producing spurious factors that look “interpretable” but are actually artifacts of imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auditability and thesis defense:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The approved pipeline methodology emphasizes transparency and conceptual justification. If the team imputes inconsistent variables without FMI, reviewers can easily challenge: “Why did you treat structurally missing data as if it were random?”"

    "It ensures that **every variable** is evaluated not only by its missingness (FMI) and consistency, but also by its **conceptual role** in financial vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity**: Variables tied to employment stability, income regularity, and sectoral risk.  \n",
    "- **Resilience**: Variables reflecting household capacity, education, skills, and adaptability.  \n",

    "#### Why automate?\n",
    "Manual factor formation was encoded into a reproducible dictionary and keyword rules.  \n",
    "This ensures consistency across runs, while still allowing customization:\n",
    "- The `dimension_map` dictionary can be edited to refine assignments.  \n",
    "- Keyword rules act as a fallback for variables not explicitly mapped.  \n",
    "- Any variable left as `\"Unclassified\"` is flagged for manual review.\n",

    "- **Theory-guided**: Dimensions are based on the approved thesis framework.  \n",
    "- **Transparent**: Every variable is listed, no silent exclusions.  \n",
    "- **Customizable**: Teammates can refine the dictionary or rationale column later.  \n",
    "- **Audit-ready**: The matrix documents not just FMI and consistency, but also conceptual relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, imputation decisions are **informed from the start**, but remain flexible for recalibration.\n"

    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation was conducted to assess whether the imputation process preserved the integrity of survey data or introduced distortions that could bias subsequent factor analysis. Metrics were computed across consistent variables to quantify distributional similarity between **NEW Renamed Fully Decoded Surveys** and **Imputed Data for Analysis** folders.\n",

    "**Key Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average RMSE: 0.0**  \n",
    "  Numeric imputation introduced no measurable deviation. This indicates either minimal missingness in numeric variables or that median imputation perfectly aligned with existing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum RMSE: 0.0**  \n",
    "  Confirms no numeric variable showed significant deviation. Numeric imputation is stable and unlikely to bias results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average KS_p: 1.0**  \n",
    "  Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests show numeric distributions are statistically indistinguishable pre‑ vs post‑imputation. Numeric imputation preserved distributional shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Chi2_p: 0.129**  \n",
    "  Chi‑square tests reveal categorical distributions shifted after imputation. A mean p‑value around 0.13 suggests moderate but widespread distributional changes, consistent with mode imputation or “Unknown” fallback altering category frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias Flags**  \n",
    "  - **No Bias Detected:** 338 variables  \n",
    "  - **Potential Bias:** 716 variables  \n",
    "  - **Not Evaluated:** 0 variables  \n",
    "  The majority of categorical variables were flagged as “Potential Bias,” highlighting distributional shifts that require sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric variables**: Imputation is defensible. No evidence of bias; distributions remain intact.  \n",
    "- **Categorical variables**: Imputation introduces distributional shifts. Mode imputation tends to over‑represent dominant categories, while “Unknown” fallback creates artificial clusters.  \n",
    "- **Overall usability**: The dataset is usable for analysis, but categorical imputation requires sensitivity checks. Factor analysis should be run both with and without imputed categorical variables to confirm robustness.  \n",
    "- **Audit trail**: Every variable was evaluated; none skipped. This strengthens transparency and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity analysis**: Compare factor loadings and KMO/Bartlett results between raw decoded vs imputed datasets.  \n",
    "- **Variable prioritization**: Focus on categorical variables flagged as “Potential Bias” for deeper review.  \n",
    "- **Alternative methods**: Explore metadata‑guided random draws or auxiliary predictor models for categorical imputation to reduce mode bias.  \n",
    "- **Documentation**: Retain this evaluation report as part of the thesis defense materials to demonstrate proactive bias quantification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Knowledge Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "In labor force surveys, **numeric variables** (e.g., age, hours worked, pay) are structurally stable and imputation via medians is unlikely to distort economic indicators.  \n",
    "**Categorical variables** (e.g., marital status, occupation codes, work indicators) are more vulnerable: imputing missing categories can shift proportions of workers across sectors or statuses, which in turn may distort factor structures related to **sensitivity, resilience, and exposure**.  \n",
    "Thus, while numeric imputation is safe, categorical imputation must be treated as **supporting evidence** and subjected to sensitivity analysis before being used as core inputs in factor analysis.\n",
