    "## Factor Analysis and Construction of Sensitivity-Resilience-Exposure (S-R-E) Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the full **factor analysis pipeline** used to derive the **Sensitivity, Resilience, and Exposure (S-R-E)** dimensions of labor vulnerability from pooled survey data. It serves as the methodological bridge between raw indicators and the final index-ready factor scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main objectives of this notebook are to:**\n",
    "- Pool imputed monthly survey datasets into a single analytical sample\n",
    "- Assess the suitability of the data for factor analysis\n",
    "- Empirically validate the S-R-E framework using statistical criteria\n",
    "- Extract and rotate latent factors from observed behavioral indicators\n",
    "- Generate individual-level **Sensitivity, Exposure, and Resilience scores**\n",
    "- Reattach these scores back to the original monthly survey files\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures that the constructed S-R-E pillars are **data-driven, empirically validated, and consistent across time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor Analysis\n",
    "Factor Analysis is applied to reduce the labor-related and demographic indicators into interpretable dimensions. This allows complex employment behaviors and demographic conditions to be summarized into coherent vulnerability pillars that can be used for regional vulnerability index construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Location\n",
    "All final survey datasets containing the original variables **plus the computed S-R-E factor scores** are saved in: `Survey Datasets with Factor Scores`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each monthly file in this directory preserves the full survey structure while adding:\n",
    "- `Sensitivity_Score`\n",
    "- `Exposure_Score`\n",
    "- `Resilience_Score`\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets are the primary inputs for index computation."

    "### Data Pooling and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis begins by consolidating individual monthly survey files into a single, unified dataset, creating a comprehensive baseline for uncovering latent population patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection of Representative Data:** Although five imputed versions were generated to address missing values, <u>Version 1 is selected as the representative dataset for Factor Analysis</u>. This choice is <u>justified by the statistical stability observed across all versions during imputation validation</u>, ensuring methodological consistency while maintaining computational efficiency for a large-scale dataset.\n",
    "- **Variable Selection and Traceability:** The dataset includes 15 variables capturing labor behaviors and demographic characteristics. Key survey identifiers (`Survey_Year`, `Survey_Month`, `Psu_Number`, `C101_Line_Number`, and `Replicate`) are preserved but excluded from Factor Analysis. These variables are not drivers of vulnerability, but they serve as anchors to enable calculated scores to be traced back to original survey units and aggregated at the regional level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the large volume of observations efficiently, only the relevant variables and identifiers are loaded from each monthly file. The resulting pooled dataframe provides scope and serves as the foundation for subsequent factor extraction and index construction."

    "\n",
    "Before performing Factor Analysis, the 15 behavioral indicators are assigned to the three theoretical pillars of the Regional Financial Vulnerability Index (RFVI): **Sensitivity**, **Resilience**, and **Exposure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mapping provides a qualitative benchmark, allowing us to compare the theoretical expectations of variable grouping with the empirical results from Factor Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Each Dimension:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity:** Reflects how easily a household’s financial condition is affected by limited work opportunities and internal resource pressure. It captures labor underutilization, unmet work needs, and household dependency, indicating how vulnerable the household is to small economic changes.\n",
    "- **Resilience:** Represents the demographic and behavioral characteristics that influence a household’s ability to cope with or recover from financial stress. These include age, marital status, household role, and readiness or willingness to work.\n",
    "- **Exposure:** Focuses on current and recent employment conditions, measuring the extent to which individuals are directly affected by labor market risks based on their job status and employment history.\n",

A close match between predicted and observed groupings provides strong evidence for the validity of this S-R-E framework."

    "\n",
    "To determine how many underlying factors exist among the behavioral indicators, the dataset is examined through its eigenvalues and the scree plot. This step checks whether the three RFVI pillars **(Sensitivity, Resilience, and Exposure)** are supported by real patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor Analysis works by identifying hidden factors that explain the shared variation among variables. Variation refers to how much values differ across observations. When variables change together in consistent ways, it indicates structured variation, suggesting that an underlying factor may be driving those patterns. Eigenvalues measure how much of this total variation each factor explains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaiser Criterion (Eigenvalue > 1):**\n",
    "Each factor is assigned an eigenvalue.\n",
    "- **Eigenvalue > 1.0:** The factor explains more variation than a single original variable and is considered meaningful.\n",
    "- **Eigenvalue < 1.0:** The factor explains little variation and is usually treated as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual check using the Scree Plot:**\n",
    "- **Y-axis:** Eigenvalue (amount of variation explained)\n",
    "- **X-axis:** Factor number\n",
    "- **Red line (Eigenvalue = 1):** Minimum threshold for retaining a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scree plot typically shows a steep drop followed by a flatter curve. The point where the curve begins to flatten (the **“elbow”**) indicates where meaningful factors end and random noise begins."

    "#### Interpretation of Eigenvalue and Scree Plot Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues and scree plot suggest that the data are best represented by **four underlying factors**. This conclusion is supported by both a numerical rule (the Kaiser Criterion) and a visual inspection of the scree plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Kaiser Criterion, factors are kept if they explain more variation than a single original variable (eigenvalue greater than 1). In this analysis, **four factors meet this requirement**, while the next factor falls below the threshold and is therefore excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scree plot shows a clear pattern where the amount of explained variation drops sharply at first and then levels off after the fourth factor. This point, known as the “elbow,” indicates where meaningful structure ends and random noise begins. These results indicate that retaining four factors captures the main patterns in the data without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the study is theoretically framed around three pillars (Sensitivity, Resilience, and Exposure), **the empirical results suggest that one of these pillars may split into a more specific sub-dimension**. This reflects meaningful structure in the data rather than a weakness in the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final validation step, **parallel analysis** is conducted next to confirm that the fourth factor represents real structure and not random variation.\n"

    "### Parallel Analysis for Factor Retention\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a more statistically rigorous decision on the number of factors, a **parallel analysis** is conducted. This method serves as a final validation step after the Kaiser Criterion and scree plot assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel analysis works by comparing the dataset’s eigenvalues with those produced from **randomly generated data** of the same size. This allows the analysis to distinguish between **real structural patterns** and variation that could occur purely by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core principle:**\n",
    "- Each factor from the real dataset has an eigenvalue.\n",
    "- A simulated dataset with no real structure is generated multiple times.\n",
    "- Eigenvalues are extracted from these random datasets.\n",
    "- The real eigenvalues are then compared to the random ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retention rule:**\n",
    "- If a real eigenvalue is **greater than the corresponding random eigenvalue**, the factor explains more variation than random noise and is retained.\n",
    "- If a real eigenvalue is **smaller**, the factor is considered statistically insignificant and discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual interpretation:**\n",
    "- The scree plot displays two curves:\n",
    "  - **Real data line:** Eigenvalues from the actual dataset.\n",
    "  - **Random data line:** Eigenvalues from simulated noise.\n",
    "- The meaningful factors are those where the **real line stays above the random line.**\n",
    "- The point where the real line falls below the random line marks the transition from **true structure to noise.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of factors where the real eigenvalues exceed the simulated ones represents the **statistically supported factor structure.** This result provides the most defensible basis for determining whether the RFVI should follow a **three-factor or four-factor structure**, ensuring that the final index reflects genuine patterns in the data rather than random variation."

    "#### Interpretation of Parallel Analysis Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel analysis indicates that the data support a **three-factor structure**, despite the earlier suggestion of four factors based on the Kaiser Criterion. This difference reflects a common distinction between identifying large factors and identifying factors that are truly distinct from random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Kaiser Criterion retains factors with eigenvalues greater than 1, parallel analysis directly compares the observed data to randomly generated data. In the parallel analysis plot, the eigenvalues from the real data exceed the random-data threshold for the first three factors only. The fourth factor, although slightly above an eigenvalue of 1, falls below the random benchmark, indicating that it is not statistically distinguishable from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result confirms that **three factors represent genuine and stable patterns** in the data, which may correspond to the Sensitivity, Resilience, and Exposure pillars. The potential fourth factor appears to reflect residual or overlapping variation rather than a distinct dimension of vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study therefore proceeds with a **three-factor solution**, which is both statistically rigorous and fully aligned with the theoretical framework."

    "\n",
    "Factor extraction reduces the shared variation among the survey indicators into a smaller set of interpretable latent dimensions. By examining factor loadings, we identify which variables move together and represent the same underlying behavioral pattern or household characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, **Principal Axis Factoring (PAF)** is used as the extraction method. PAF focuses on the **shared variance** among variables rather than total variance, making it well-suited for uncovering latent constructs that reflect common behavioral patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promax rotation (oblique)** was applied to the extracted factors. This allows the factors to **correlate naturally**, reflecting the realistic expectation that Sensitivity, Exposure, and Resilience dimensions are related dimensions of vulnerability rather than perfectly independent phenomena. Oblique rotation improves interpretability by producing a simpler, more meaningful factor structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Factor Extraction:**\n",
    "- Translate shared variation of variables into interpretable pillars.\n",
    "- Identify which behavioral indicators define each dimension.\n",

    "#### Factor Extraction and Loading Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Factor Analysis reduces the variation in the 15 behavioral indicators into three main underlying pillars. The three-factor solution, confirmed by Parallel Analysis, aligns closely with the theoretical **S-R-E framework**. Loadings with absolute values greater than **0.4** are considered significant contributors to each factor. A positive relationship indicates that two variables move in the same direction, meaning they increase or decrease together, while a negative relationship describes variables that move in opposite directions, where the increase of one corresponds to the decrease of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Factor 1: Sensitivity (Labor Adjustment Behavior)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor is defined by variables related to **adjustments in work intensity** and the **pursuit of additional employment opportunities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong loadings:**\n",
    "- New_Employment_Criteria (0.919)\n",
    "- Look_for_Additional_Work (0.828)\n",
    "- Other_Job_Indicator (0.737)\n",

    "- Total_Hours_Worked_for_all_Jobs (-0.833)\n",
    "- Work_Indicator (-0.702)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity represents how strongly a worker’s current labor situation responds to economic pressures. The positively loaded variables capture behaviors that signal **unmet labor needs**, such as looking for additional work, wanting more hours, or setting new employment criteria. In contrast, the negatively loaded variables reflect ****actual work intensity and work status****, such as hours worked and whether the person is currently working.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse relationship indicates that individuals with **lower current work intensity** tend to exhibit **stronger adjustment behaviors**, such as searching for more work or wanting additional hours. This pattern reflects a state of labor vulnerability where small economic changes can significantly affect the worker’s situation. Therefore, these variables collectively define the **Sensitivity** dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Factor 2: Exposure (Job Search and Availability)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor is primarily driven by variables associated with **availability for work** and **active job-seeking behavior**.\n",

    "**Strong loadings:**\n",
    "- Available_for_Work (0.913)\n",
    "- Looked_for_Work_or_Tried_to_Establish_Business (0.881)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Exposure reflects the degree to which an individual is **directly engaged with and dependent on the labor market** for employment. Both variables represent core components of labor market participation: being available for work and actively seeking employment or starting a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators move together because individuals who are actively searching for work are also typically available to start employment. This reflects a state of **direct exposure to labor market risks**, such as unemployment, job competition, and economic fluctuations. Since these variables capture immediate interaction with the labor market, they collectively define the **Exposure** dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Factor 3: Resilience (Demographic and Household Anchors)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor is defined by **demographic** and **household-structure** variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong loadings:**\n",
    "- Relationship_to_Household_Head (0.807)\n",
    "- Age (0.549)\n",
    "- Previous_Job_Indicator (0.449)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Resilience represents the **structural and life-cycle characteristics** that influence an individual’s capacity to withstand labor market shocks. Age reflects accumulated experience and position in the life cycle, while previous job experience indicates familiarity with the labor market. Relationship to the household head captures **household role and potential support structures**, which can affect economic stability and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables move together because they describe relatively **stable, long-term characteristics** rather than short-term labor adjustments. Such characteristics often determine a person’s ability to cope with employment disruptions, access support, or re-enter the workforce. This shared structural pattern forms the **Resilience** dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Why the Three-Factor Solution Was Retained\n",
    "\n",
    "In the four-factor solution, the indicators *Look for Additional Work*, *Want More Hours of Work*, and *Other Job Indicator* separated from Factor 1 and formed a fourth factor. This new factor **did not represent a distinct type of vulnerability**. Instead, it simply split an existing set of closely related sensitivity indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three-factor model keeps these indicators together under a single Sensitivity factor, making the results **easier to understand and more coherent**. Each factor in the three-factor solution is supported by several strong loadings, while the fourth factor in the alternative model is driven by only a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, the three-factor solution is selected. It is simpler, more stable, and directly aligned with the Sensitivity-Resilience-Exposure (S-R-E) framework of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Overall Insight**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that the variables naturally cluster into three coherent groups, each representing a distinct behavioral or structural pattern. This indicates that the Sensitivity, Exposure, and Resilience pillars are **not only theoretical constructs** but are also **supported by the empirical relationships observed in the data**."

    "\n",
    "After extracting and interpreting the factors, an additional diagnostic step is performed to assess **cross-loadings**. Cross-loading occurs when a variable shows a strong association with more than one factor at the same time (> 0.4). This can indicate that the factors are not clearly separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this step is to evaluate the **clarity and purity of the factor structure**. In a well-defined model, each indicator should primarily relate to one factor only, reinforcing the interpretation that each pillar captures a distinct aspect of vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure identifies indicators whose absolute factor loadings exceed a specified threshold (0.4) on more than one factor. Such cases would suggest that the indicator is simultaneously measuring multiple dimensions, potentially weakening the conceptual distinction between the factors."

    "#### Interpretation of Table 1: Variable Communalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 presents the communalities (h²) of each behavioral variable, indicating how much of each variable’s variance is explained by the three extracted factors (Sensitivity, Exposure, and Resilience).\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Representation:** Variables such as New Employment Criteria (0.845), Available for Work (0.845), Normal Working Hours per Day (0.839), and Looked for Work or Tried to Establish Business (0.812) show high communalities, meaning they are strongly represented in the factor model. This indicates that core labor participation and job-search behaviors are central to the underlying dimensions of vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moderate Representation:** Total Hours Worked (0.711), Look for Additional Work (0.686), Relationship to Head (0.654), Work Indicator (0.583), Other Job Indicator (0.543), and Want More Hours (0.502) also show moderate communalities, still contributing meaningfully to the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low Representation:** Some variables (mostly demographic) exhibit low communalities, such as Age (0.479), Previous Job Indicator (0.287), Sex (0.095), Marital Status (0.149), and Household Size (0.039), meaning their movements are largely independent of the other economic behaviors in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that the factor model is primarily driven by labor participation and job-search behaviors, while basic demographic characteristics contribute less to the shared factor structure. This supports the idea that the extracted factors are capturing behavioral aspects of labor vulnerability rather than purely demographic traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Table 2: Inter-Factor Correlation Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 2 presents the **correlations among the three extracted factors**: Sensitivity (F1), Exposure (F2), and Resilience (F3). As expected, each factor is perfectly correlated with itself (1.000). The important values are the correlations between different factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity and Exposure** show a moderate positive correlation (0.317). This suggests that individuals who are more sensitive to labor market changes also tend to have higher levels of exposure to labor-related risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity and Resilience** have a weak to moderate positive correlation (0.266). This indicates that while the two factors are related, they still represent distinct dimensions of labor conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the correlations are positive but not too high, meaning **the factors are related yet conceptually separate**. This supports the use of an oblique factor model, where the dimensions of Sensitivity, Exposure, and Resilience are allowed to be connected but still measure different aspects of labor vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Table 3: Total Variance Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 3 quantifies how much information from the original 15 survey variables is successfully captured by the three factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1 (Sensitivity)**\n",
    "  - Eigenvalue: 6.057\n",
    "  - Explains **40.38% of the total variance**\n",
    "  - Interpretation: As the **dominant factor**, Sensitivity captures the largest share of variation. This confirms that labor adjustment behaviors (demand for more work vs. actual hours) represent the most prominent dimension of vulnerability in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F2 (Exposure)**\n",
    "  - Eigenvalue: 2.239\n",
    "  - Explains **14.93% of the total variance**\n",
    "  - Interpretation: Exposure contributes meaningfully to explaining variability in labor market participation and job-seeking behaviors, forming a **distinct but smaller dimension** than Sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F3 (Resilience)**\n",
    "  - Eigenvalue: 1.270\n",
    "  - Explains **8.46% of the total variance**\n",
    "  - Interpretation: Resilience captures variation in demographic and household-related anchors. While smaller in magnitude, it represents a **unique structural dimension** that complements the other two factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cumulative Variance:** The three factors together explain **63.77% of the total variance**, indicating that the **S-R-E framework effectively summarizes most of the shared patterns** in the behavioral indicators, supporting its validity for constructing the vulnerability index."

    "\n",
    "Factor scoring converts the results of factor analysis into **numerical scores** for each observation, showing where they stand on the three dimensions: **Sensitivity**, **Exposure**, and **Resilience**. These scores are the foundation for building the Regional Financial Vulnerability Index (RFVI).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Overview:**\n",

    "- **Organizing Scores:** The resulting scores are placed in a table with clear column names: `Sensitivity_Score`, `Exposure_Score`, and `Resilience_Score`.\n",
    "- **Adding Scores to the Dataset:** These scores are merged with the original dataset, keeping all original variables intact for reference and further analysis."
